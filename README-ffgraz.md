# Gluon FFGraz Fork

Contributors: Maciej Kr√ºger, Alexander List

Difference to upstream (anticpiated):

- olsrv1 support
- IPv4 support

These are needed for a non-disruptive migration of FunkFeuer Graz to gluon / OLSRv2.

This delta should eventually go away once all the features we need are available upstream.
